# Naive-Summation
This application analyzes numerical errors in naive summation (sequential accumulation). Random values in [â€“1,1] are summed for sizes up to 100k. True sums (longdouble) are compared with naive results. Absolute error grows with n, while relative error fluctuates due to cancellation.
